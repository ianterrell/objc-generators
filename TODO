# Overall

- Combine all generators in one mega ProjectGenerator so that repetitive directory, project commands can be skipped.
- Optionally make directory take a block that only generates in that directory, versus setting project wide setting.

# SqlitePOGenerator

Add lazy-loading association methods to generated classes if proven helpful.

i.e., from http://groups.google.com/group/sqlitepersistentobjects-user/browse_thread/thread/b84066a07456234b:

- (NSArray *)children {
  NSArray *children = [self findRelated:[Children class]];
  return children;
}
